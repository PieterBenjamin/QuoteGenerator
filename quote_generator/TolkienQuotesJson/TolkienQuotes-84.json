For the Children of Il\u00favatar were conceived by him alone; and they came with the third theme, and were not in the theme which Il\u00favatar propounded at the beginning, and none of the Ainur had part in their making. Therefore when they beheld them, the more did they love them, being things other than themselves, strange and free, wherein they saw the mind of Il\u00favatar reflected anew, and learned yet a little more of his wisdom, which otherwise had been hidden even from the Ainur.\u201d\n", " \u201cStrange are the turns of fortune! Often does hatred hurt itself!\u201d\n", " \u201cThen he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: The Eagles are coming!
