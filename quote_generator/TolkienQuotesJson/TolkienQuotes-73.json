I distrust the silence. I distrust even the pale Moon. The stars are faint; and I am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no Ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than in the limb.\u201d\n", " \u201cFaramir smiled. \"A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards. I had no lure or desire to do other than what I have done.\"\n \"Ah well, sir,\" said Sam, \"you said my master had an elvish air; and that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of--well, Gandalf, of wizards.\"\n \"Maybe,\" said Faramir. \"Maybe you discern from far away the air of N\u00famenor. Good night!\u201d\n", " \u201cFor as the Rohirrim do, we now love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; and\u201d\n", " \u201cThings are drawing to the end now, unless\n I am mistaken.

He calls things like that carrocks, and this one is the Carrock because it is the only one near his home and he knows it well.\u201d\n", " \u201cIn later days he [Ol\u00f3rin] dearly loved the Children of Eru, and took pity on their sorrows. Those who hearkened to him arose from despair; and in their hearts the desire to heal and to renew awoke, and thoughts of fair things that had not yet been but might yet be made for the enrichment of Arda.\u201d\n", " \u201cGood night, captain, my lord,' he said. 'You took the chance, sir.'\n 'Did I so?' said Faramir.\n Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'\n Faramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Samwise.

Horns, horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin\u2019s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the North wildly blowing.

Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the ring around the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!\n Tom laughed again, and then hespun the Ring in the air - and it vanished with a flash.

People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name.\u201d\n", " \u201cShow me the precious Ring!'

You must either go through or give up your quest.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd if you do come back, you will never be the same\u201d\n", " \u201cSave me!\" said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. \"There I go again! 'Whenever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it' the Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear!\u201d\n", " \u201cLiterature works from mind to mind and is more progenitive. It is at once more universal and more poignantly particular. If it speaks of bread or wine or stone or tree, it appeals to the whole of these things, to their ideas; yet each hearer will give to them a peculiar personal embodiment in his imagination. Should the story say 'he ate bread', the dramatic producer or painter can only show 'a piece of bread' according to his taste or fancy, but the hearer of the story will think of bread in general and picture it in some form of his own. If a story says 'he climbed a hill and saw a river in the valley below', the illustrator may catch, or nearly catch, his own vision of such a scene; but every hearer of the words will have his own picture, and it will be made out of all the hills and rivers and dales he has ever seen, but especially out of The Hill, The River, The Valley which were for him the first embodiment of the word.\u201d\n"]
