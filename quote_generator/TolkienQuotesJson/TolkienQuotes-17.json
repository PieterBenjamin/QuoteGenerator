There he took up again his great Ring in Barad-dur, and dwelt there, dark and silent, until he wrought himself a new guise, an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure.\u201d\n", " \u201cThere is a place called \u2018heaven\u2019 where the good here unfinished is completed; and where the stories unwritten, and the hopes unfulfilled, are continued.

'And as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through more battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though you be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of Isengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on him, or I would wake him. His name is Peregrin, a very valiant man.'\n Man?' said Ingold dubiously; and the others laughed.\n Man!' cried Pippin, now thoroughly roused. 'Man! Indeed not! I am a hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now and again by necessity. Do not let Gandalf deceive you!\u201d\n", " \u201cUn Anello per domarli, Un Anello per trovarli,\n Un Anello per ghermirli e nel buio incatenarli.\u201d\n", " \u201cOft it may be chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were heedful for the wise to know.\u201d\n", " \u201cOh! That was poetry!\" said Pippin. \"Do you really mean to start before the break of day?\u201d\n", " \u201cO!

We boast seldom, and then perform, or die in the attempt. \"Not if I found it on the highway would I take it,\" I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those words as a vow, and be held by them.\u201d\n", " \u201cIf you sit on the doorstep long enough, I daresay you will think of something\u201d\n", " \u201cI am at home among trees.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe Eleven king looked sternly upon Thorin, when he was brought before him, and asked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving.\n \"Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their merrymaking?\" asked the king.\n \"We did not attack them,\" answered Thorin, \"we came to beg because we were starving.\"\n \"Where are your friends now, and what are they doing?\"\n \"I don't know, but I expect that they're all starving in the forest.\"\n \"What were you doing in the forest?\"\n \"Looking for food and drink, because we were starving.\"\n \"And what brought you into the forest at all?\" asked the king angrily.\n At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word.\u201d\n", " \u201cThen she fell on her knees, saying: 'I beg thee!'\n 'Nay, lady,' he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her.

The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that\u2019s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually \u2013 their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn\u2019t. And if they had, we shouldn\u2019t know, because they\u2019d have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on \u2013 and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same \u2013 like old Mr. Bilbo.
