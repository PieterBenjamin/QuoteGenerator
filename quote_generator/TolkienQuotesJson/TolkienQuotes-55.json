[" \u201cYou do not know your danger, Theoden.

It\u2019s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn\u2019t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it\u2019s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn\u2019t. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.\u201d\n", " \u201cIn the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was singing.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe mantle was wrought for his mother, Finduilas of Amroth, who died untimely, and was to him but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief; and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of \u00c9owyn.\u201d\n", " \u201cMaybe,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018and I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart desires.

Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought hardened him.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt was not very long before he discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure in which the hobbit again showed his usefulness.\u201d\n", " \u201cHe looked at Frodo and smiled. \u2018Very well,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think that will do \u2013 but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In the meanwhile, do take care, and don\u2019t let out any hint of where you are going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him into a toad.\u2019 \u2018As for where I am going,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t be absurd!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I am not warning you against leaving an address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire \u2013 and that should not be known, until you are far away.\u201d\n", " \u201cWhat a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!\u2019 \u2018Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.\u201d\n", " \u201cominous and disquieting.

The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night. Tom\u201d\n", " \u201cGandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside,\u201d\n", " \u201cI think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,\" said Frodo. \"And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.\u201d\n", " \u201cBut of bliss and glad life there is little to be said, before it ends; as works fair and wonderful, while still they endure for eyes to see, are their own record, and only when they are in peril or broken for ever do they pass into song.\u201d\n", " \u201cToo swiftly by in love do slip our gentle years.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt is easy for the student to feel that with all his labour he is collecting only a few leaves, many of them now torn or decayed, from the countless foliage of the Tree of Tales, with which the Forest of Days is carpeted. It seems vain to add to the litter. Who can design a new leaf? The patterns from bud to unfolding, and the colours from spring to autumn were all discovered by men long ago. But that is not true. The seed of the tree can be replanted in almost any soil, even in one so smoke-ridden (as Lang said) as that of England. Spring is, of course, not really less beautiful because we have seen or heard of other like events: like events, never from world's beginning to world's end the same event. Each leaf, of oak and ash and thorn, is a unique embodiment of the pattern, and for some this very year may be\n embodiment, the first ever seen and recognized, though oaks have put forth leaves for countless generations of men.\n We do not, or need not, despair of drawing because all lines must be either curved or straight, nor of painting because there are only three 'primary' colours. We may indeed be older now, in so far as we are heirs in enjoyment or in practice of many generations of ancestors in the arts. In this inheritance of wealth there may be a danger of boredom or of anxiety to be original, and that may lead to a distaste for fine drawing, delicate pattern, and 'pretty' colours, or else to mere manipulation and over-elaboration of old material, clever and heartless. But the true road of escape from such weariness is not to be found in the willfully awkward, clumsy, or misshapen, not in making all things dark or unremittingly violent; nor in the mixing of colours on through subtlety to drabness, and the fantastical complication of shapes to the point of silliness and on towards delirium. Before we reach such states we need recovery. We should look at green again, and be startled anew (but not blinded) by blue and yellow and red. We should meet the centaur and the dragon, and then perhaps suddenly behold, like the ancient shepherds, sheep, and dogs, and horses \u2013 and wolves. This recovery fairy-stories help us to make. In that sense only a taste for them may make us, or keep us, childish.\u201d\n", " \u201c...present and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of Time.\u201d\n", " \u201cPoor Mr. Baggins\u2014it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all alone, and always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring,\u201d\n", " \u201cGet out, you old Wight!
