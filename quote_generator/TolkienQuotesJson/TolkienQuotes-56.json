[" \u201cFantasy is a natural human activity. It certainly does not destroy or even insult Reason; and it does not either blunt the appetite for, nor obscure the perception of, scientific verity.

And that may be an encouraging thought.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms.

So you see \u2018prisoners\u2019 had meant \u2018prisoners rescued from the goblins\u2019 only, and not captives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized that at last they were going to escape really and truly from the dreadful mountains.
