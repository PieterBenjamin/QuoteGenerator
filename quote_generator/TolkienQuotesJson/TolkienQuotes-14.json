For this is the Ring of Fire, and herewith, maybe, thou shalt rekindle hearts to the valour of old in a world that grows chill.\u201d\n", " \u201cNo, my heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell and has returned and is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon our knees.\u201d\n", " \u201cFantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisoned by the enemy, don't we consider it his duty to escape?\u201d\n", " \u201cWell, you have now, Sam, dear Sam,\u2019 said Frodo, and he lay back in Sam\u2019s gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when night-fears are driven away by some loved voice or hand. Sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness...\u201d\n", " \u201cFar over the Misty Mountains cold,\n To dungeons deep and caverns old,\n We must away, ere break of day,\n To seek our pale enchanted gold.\n The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\n While hammers fell like ringing bells,\n In places deep, where dark things sleep,\n In hollow halls beneath the fells.\n The pines were roaring on the heights,\n The wind was moaning in the night,\n The fire was red, it flaming spread,\n The trees like torches blazed with light.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd amid all the splendours of the World, its vast halls and spaces, and its wheeling fires, Il\u00favatar chose a place for their habitation in the Deeps of Time and in the midst of the innumerable stars.\u201d\n", " \u201cI don't know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't right to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want - I don't rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.\u201d\n", " \u201cFire, fear, foes! Awake!\u201d\n", " \u201cplease don't cook me, kind sirs! I am a good cook myself, and cook better than I cook, if you see what I mean.\u201d\n", " \u201cI'll get there, if I leave everything but my bones behind,\" said Sam. \"And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd she looked at him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred among men of war, that here was one whom no Rider of the Mark could outmatch in battle.\u201d\n", " \u201cYes, I am white now,' said Gandalf. 'Indeed I am Saruman, one might almost say, Saruman as he should have been.\u201d\n", " \u201cSm\u00e9agol won't grub for roots and carrotses and - taters. What's taters, precious, eh, what's taters?'\n 'Po-ta-toes,' said Sam. 'The Gaffer's delight, and rare good ballast for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you needn't look. But be good Sm\u00e9agol and fetch me some herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more, if you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you some taters one of these days. I will: fried fish and chips served by S. Gamgee. You couldn't say no to that.' 'Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish\n , and keep nassty chips!'\n 'Oh, you're hopeless,' said Sam. 'Go to sleep!\u201d\n", " \u201cNever laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!' he said to himself, and it became a favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb. 'You aren't nearly through this adventure yet,' he added, and that was pretty true as well.\u201d\n", " \u201cAre you in pain, Frodo?' said Gandalf quietly as he rode by Frodo's side.\n 'Well, yes I am,' said Frodo. 'It is my shoulder. The wound aches, and the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.'\n 'Alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,' said Gandalf.\n 'I fear it may be so with mine,' said Frodo. 'There is no real going back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden.

I will be a Shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.\u201d\n", " \u201cOver the field rang his clear voice calling: \u2018Death!

And of course they are as a rule quite right: they did make a mistake. Only a very wise man at the end of his life could make a sound judgment concerning whom, amongst the total chances, he ought most profitably to have married! Nearly all marriages, even happy ones, are mistakes: in the sense that almost certainly (in a more perfect world, or even with a little more care in this very imperfect one) both partners might have found more suitable mates. But the 'real soul-mate' is the one you are actually married to.\u201d\n", " \u201cA nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly.\u201d\n"]
