By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.\u201d\n", " \u201cWhen my father was a young man, during the years of the First World War and long before there was any inkling of the tales that were to form the narrative of The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings, he began the writing of a collection of stories that he called The Book of Lost Tales. That was his first work of imaginative literature, and a substantial one, for though it was left unfinished there are fourteen completed tales. It was in The Book of Lost Tales that there first appeared in narrative the Gods, or Valar; Elves and Men as the Children of Il\u00favatar (the Creator); Melkor-Morgoth the great Enemy; Balrogs and Orcs; and the lands in which the Tales are set, Valinor \u2018land of the Gods\u2019 beyond the western ocean, and the \u2018Great Lands\u2019 (afterwards called \u2018Middle-earth\u2019, between the seas of east and west).\u201d\n", " \u201cIn that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger.

We did not bring them to rest against your wall, Lord of the Mark.

A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-room: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I shall roast him.\u201d\n", " \u201cI was very comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that: it does not look like coming true; and evidently there will have to be several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful nuisance.\u201d\n", " \u201cAt last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice. \u2018I will take the Ring,\u2019 he said, \u2018though I do not know the way.\u2019 Elrond\u201d\n", " \u201cHis house was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or singing, or just sitting and thinking, best, or a pleasant mixture of them all.\u201d\n", " \u201cHow far back his treachery goes, who can guess?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018He was not always evil. Once I do not doubt that he was the friend of Rohan; and even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now he has plotted your ruin, wearing the mask of friendship, until he was ready. In those years Wormtongue\u2019s task was easy, and all that you did was swiftly known in Isengard; for your land was open, and strangers came and went. And ever Wormtongue\u2019s whispering was in your ears, poisoning your thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!

But all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come.
