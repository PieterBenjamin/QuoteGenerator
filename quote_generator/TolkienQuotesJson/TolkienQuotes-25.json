[" \u201cThe wise speak only of what they know, Gr\u00edma son of G\u00e1lm\u00f3d. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy words with a serving-man till the lightning falls.' There was a roll of thunder. The sunlight became blotted out from the eastern windows; the whole hall became suddenly dark as night. The fire faded to sullen embers. Only Gandalf could be seen, standing white and tall before the blackened hearth.\u201d\n", " \u201cSpeak, or I will put a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find hard to deal with!\u201d\n", " \u201cOf course, it is likely enough, my friends,\" he said slowly, \"likely enough that we are going to our dooms: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later.\u201d\n", " \u201cNo half-heartedness and no worldly fear must turn us aside from following the light unflinchingly.\u201d\n", " \u201cSuch bees!

But it was not a 'tree' until someone gave it that name. You call a star a star, and say it is just a ball of matter moving on a mathematical course. But that is merely how you see it. By so naming things and describing them you are only inventing your own terms about them. And just as speech is invention about objects and ideas, so myth is invention about truth.\n We have come from God (continued Tolkien), and inevitably the myths woven by us, though they contain error, will also reflect a splintered fragment of the true light, the eternal truth that is with God. Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming a 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall. Out myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbor, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of evil.\u201d\n", " \u201cLeave him! I said. I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon; and if any of these Black Riders try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said.

'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He was quite right, but he never found out any more about it.\u201d\n", " \u201cGaladriel his sister went not with him to Nargothrond, for in Doriath dwelt Celeborn, kinsman of Thingol, and there was great love between them. Therefore she remained in the Hidden Kingdom, and abode with Melian, and of her learned great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, and I smell it in the air.\u201d\n", " \u201cI feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don't expect I shall return. in fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all arrangements....\n I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can't be right.

A voice shouted in the dark: 'Who's that? Be off! You can't come in. Can't you read the notice: No admittance between sundown and sunrise?' 'Of course we can't read the notice in the dark,' Sam shouted back. 'And if hobbits of the Shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like this, I'll tear down your notice when I find it.\u201d\n", " \u201cThere was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Il\u00favatar; and he made first the Ainur, the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought, and they were with him before aught else was made.\u201d\n", " \u201cHere ends the SILMARILLION. If it has passed from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin, that was of old the fate of Arda Marred; and if any change shall come and the Marring be amended, Manw\u00eb and Varda may know; but they have not revealed it, and it is not declared in the dooms of Mandos.\u201d\n", " \u201cThen shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of Shadow.\u201d\n", " \u201cAll the same, I should like it all plain and clear,\" said he obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation. \"Also I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth\"--by which he meant: \"What am I going to get out of it ? and am I going to come back alive?\u201d\n", " \u201cBut you will be healed.

Thingol does but grant us lands where his power does not run. Indeed Doriath alone would be his realm this day but for the coming of the Noldor. Therefore in Doriath let him reign and be glad that he has the sons of Finwe for his neighbours not the Orcs of Morgoth that we found.\u201d\n", " \u201cGood stories deserve a little embellishment.\u201d\n", " \u201cFaithful heart may have froward tongue.\u201d\n", " \u201che was for long my only audience... Only from him did I ever get the idea that my \u2018stuff\u2019 could be more than a private hobby.

It's a pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play in it, for good or evil, before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.' Frodo: 'I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.'\n Gandalf: 'So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides that of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you were also meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.\u201d\n", " \u201cLa Fantas\u00eda es una actividad connatural al hombre.
