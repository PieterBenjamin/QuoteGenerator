In later days he was the friend of all the Children of Il\u00favatar, and took pity on their sorrows; and those who listened to him awoke from despair and put away the imaginations of darkness.\u201d\n", " \u201cMiddle-earth is ... not my own invention.

He began to say to himself: \u2018Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.\u2019 To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.\u201d\n", " \u201cVery well, Mr. Baggins,' said the leader, pushing the barrier aside.

Part of the attraction of the L.R. is, I think, due to the glimpses of a large history in the background: an attraction like that of viewing far off an unvisited island, or seeing the towers of a distant city gleaming in a sunlit mist. To go there is to destroy the magic, unless new unattainable vistas are again revealed. Also many of the older legends are purely 'mythological', and nearly all are grim and tragic: a long account of the disasters that destroyed the beauty of the Ancient World, from the darkening of Valinor to the Downfall of Numenor and the flight of Elendil.\u201d\n", " \u201c(...) visoko ti gleda\u0161, ali ja se bojim nisko pasti.\u201d\n", " \u201cBut it is a heavy burden.
