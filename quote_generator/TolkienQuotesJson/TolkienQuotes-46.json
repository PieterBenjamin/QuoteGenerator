And he issued forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the King like a tower, iron-crowned, and his vast shield, sable unblazoned, cast a shadow over him like a stormcloud.

Then L\u00fathien catching up her winged robe sprang into the air, and her voice came dropping down like rain into pools, profound and dark. She cast her cloak before his eyes, and set upon him a dream, dark as the outer Void where once he walked alone.\u201d\n", " \u201cHay una semilla de coraje oculta (a menudo profundamente, es cierto) en el coraz\u00f3n del m\u00e1s gordo y t\u00edmido de los hobbits, esperando a alg\u00fan peligro para germinar\u201d\n", " \u201cSoft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots.\u201d\n", " \u201cBlunt the knives.\n Bend the forks.\n Smash the bottles and burn the corks.\n Chip the glasses and crack the plates.\n That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!\u201d\n", " \u201cThe bigger things get the smaller and duller or flatter the globe gets.

Old beyond guessing, they seemed. Great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, blowing and swaying in the breeze.

What then will they do: match naked hands against iron and die in vain, or flee leaving the cries of women behind them?
