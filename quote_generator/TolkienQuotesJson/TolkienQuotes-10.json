A sane being would have given up, but Samwise burned with a magnificent madness, a glowing obsession to surmount every obstacle, to find Frodo, destroy the Ring, and cleanse Middle Earth of its festering malignancy. He knew he would try again. Fail, perhaps. And try once more. A thousand, thousand times if need be, but he would not give up the quest.\u201d\n", " \u201cMy Precious, my Precious.\u201d\n", " \u201cWhy, Sam,\u201d he said, \u201cto hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the\n story was already written.

All men must die, but for every man his death is an accident, and even if he knows it he would sense to it an unjustifiable violation.'

A little to the left facing them stood whom he had called Dernhelm. But the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her, and and her bright hair, released from its bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders.
