[" \u201cThey seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,\" answered Sam slowly. \"It don't seem to matter what I think about them.

We do not. It is wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy!\u201d\n", " \u201cLady Und\u00f3miel,\" said Aragorn, \"the hour is indeed hard, yet it was made even in that day when we met under the white birches in the garden of Elrond where none now walk.

And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the Dark Power that rules the Rings.\u201d\n", " \u201cAmong those who still have enough wisdom not to think fairy-stories are pernicious, the common opinion seems to be that there is a natural connection between the minds of children and fairy-stories, of the same order as the connection between children's bodies and milk. I think this is an error; at best an error of false sentiment, and one that is therefore most often made by those who, for whatever private reason (such as childlessness), tend to think of children as a special kind of creature, almost a different race, rather than normal, if immature, members of a particular family, and of the human family at large.\u201d\n", " \u201cMaedhros did deeds of surpassing valour, and the Orcs fled before his face; for since his torment upon Thangorodrim his spirit burned like a white fire within, and he was as one that returns from the dead.\u201d\n", " \u201cDo not go to the elves for council for they will say both yes and no.\u201d\n", " \u201cIts strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron\u2019s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning.\u201d\n", " \u201cIf thou hadst thy will what wouldst thou reserve?\" said Manwe. \"Of all thy realm what dost thou hold dearest?\"\n All have their worth,\" said Yavanna, \"and each contributes to the worth of the others. But the kelvar can flee or defend themselves, whereas the olvar that grow cannot. And among these I hold trees dear. Long in the growing, swift shall they be in the felling, and unless they pay toll with fruit upon their bough little mourned in their passing. So I see in my thought, would that the trees might speak on behalf of all things that have roots, and punish those that wrong them!\u201d\n", " \u201cBy Elbereth and L\u00fathien the Fair,\u2019 said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, \u2018you shall have neither the Ring nor me!\u201d\n", " \u201cI seem to see ahead, in a kind of way.

Then Gothmog hewed him with his black axe, and a white flame sprang up from the helm of Fingon as it was cloven. Thus fell the High King of the Noldor; and they beat him into the dust with their maces; and his banner, blue and silver, they trod into the mire of his blood.\u201d\n", " \u201cRoads go ever ever on\n Under cloud and under star\n Yet feet that wandering have gone\n Turn at last to home afar.\n Eyes that fire and sword have seen\n And horror in the halls of stone\n Look at last on meadows green\n And trees and hills they long have known.\u201d\n", " \u201cBilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed)\u2014Gandalf came by.\u201d\n", " \u201cI have...

There the River flows in stony vales amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of Mordor.\u201d\n", " \u201cent.
