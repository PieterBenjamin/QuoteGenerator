[" \u201cIf I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject\u2014which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd she answered: \u2018All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.\u201d\n", " \u201cPara aquel que no conoce la piedad, los hechos piadosos son extra\u00f1os e incomprensibles.\u201d\n", " \u201cI found not being able to use a pen or pencil as defeating as the loss of her beak would be to a hen.\u201d\n", " \u201cTu destino est\u00e1 en ti mismo, no en tu nombre.\u201d\n", " \u201cDon't you let go. Don't let go. Reach!\u201d\n", " \u201cThe mind that thought of light, heavy, grey, yellow, still, swift, also conceived of magic that would make heavy things light and be able to fly, turn grey lead into yellow gold, and the still rock into a swift water.\u201d\n", " \u201cFrodo: Mordor. I hope the others find a safer route.\n Sam: Strider will look after them.\n Frodo: I don\u2019t suppose we\u2019ll ever see them again.\n Sam: We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may.\u201d\n", " \u201cGive with a free hand, but give only of your own.\u201d\n", " \u201cSmeagol won't grub for roots and carrotses and - taters.

To the Grey Havens\n Sam: They're leaving Middle-earth.\n Frodo: Never to return.\u201d\n", " \u201cI do really wish to destroy it!' cried Frodo. 'Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?\u201d\n", " \u201cWe're going on a bit too fast. You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point: \"Shut the book now, dad; we don't want to read any more.\u201d\n", " \u201cHowever it may prove, one must tread the path that need chooses!\u201d\n", " \u201cA day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.\n Aragorn, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\u201d\n", " \u201cDunia memang penuh bahaya, dan di dalamnya banyak tempat gelap; tapi masih banyak hal indah, dan meski di semua negeri sekarang cinta tercampur dengan duka, mungkin dia justru tumbuh semakin hebat.\u201d\n", " \u201cAs they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.\u201d\n", " \u201cVerily,' said Gandalf, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, 'that way lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom hangs still on a thread. Yet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for a little while.\u201d\n", " \u201cThere is darkness there that never sleeps.\u201d\n", " \u201cUnmasking the intentions of a Satanic character: He cannot be both counselor and tyrant.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears. - Boromir\u201d\n", " \u201cEscape from goblins to be caught by wolves.\u201d\n", " \u201cA small oversight, but it proved fatal.

It will be long ere I am seen among the Noldor again; and it may be that we shall not meet a second time in death or life, for the fates of our kindreds are apart. Farewell!' He died then in the dark, in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, whose great tower he himself had built. Thus King Finrod Felagund, fairest and most beloved of the house of Finw\u00eb, redeemed his oath; but Beren mourned beside him in despair.\u201d\n", " \u201cGoing on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait.\u201d\n", " \u201cGo now, and die in what way seems best to you.\u201d\n", " \u201cBoromir was a valiant member of our Company,' said Frodo at length.
