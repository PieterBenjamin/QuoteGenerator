[" \u201cIt was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the D\u00fanedain, who had in their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of personal names out of the past. About\u201d\n", " \u201cIf you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you would take the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or better.\u201d\n", " \u201cI should want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as tame as a rabbit.\u201d\n", " \u201cTo walk into peril \u2013 to Mordor.\u201d\n", " \u201cYou should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the terraces and towers upon the Mountain's sides! Then you would see that we have not been idle.\u201d\n", " \u201cI do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe Elder, you say, are unpunished, and even those who rebelled do not die. Yet that is to them neither reward nor punishment, but the fulfilment of their being. They cannot escape, and are bound to this world, never to leave it so long as it lasts, for its life is theirs. And you are punished for the rebellion of Men, you say, in which you had small part, and so it is that you die. But that was not at first appointed for a punishment. Thus you escape, and leave the world, and are not bound to it, in hope or in weariness. Which of us therefore should envy the others?\u201d\n", " \u201cDon\u2019t be precise,\u201d said Dwalin, \u201cand don\u2019t worry! You will have to manage without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to the journey\u2019s end.\u201d\n", " \u201ceach had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against Sauron to others.\u201d\n", " \u201cI have some counsel for hardy hearts.\u2019 The\u201d\n", " \u201cBut after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,\u2019 answered Aragorn. \u2018Maybe there is no right choice,\u2019 said Gimli.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt is best to love first what you are fitted to love,\u201d\n", " \u201cthe West, And far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest.\u2019 Treebeard\u201d\n", " \u201cWe do not desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What\u201d\n", " \u201cActually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was somebody\u2019s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But they never got tired of them.\u201d\n", " \u201cLazy Lob and crazy Cob are weaving webs to wind me. I am far more sweet than other meat, but still they cannot find me! Here am I, naughty little fly; you are fat and lazy. You cannot trap me, though you try, in your cobwebs crazy.\u201d\n", " \u201cNow he will ever remember thee in the sun of morning, and that last evening by the water of Aeluin in which he saw thy face mirrored with a star caught in thy hair -ever, until the North-wind brings the night of his flame.

I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.\u201d\n", " \u201cremember H\u00farin; for without mortal Men the Elves shall not prevail against the Balrogs and the Orcs.\u201d\n", " \u201cWhen winter first begins to bite and stones crack in the frosty night, when pools are black and trees are bare, \u2019tis evil in the Wild to fare.\u201d\n", " \u201cOne Ring to rule them all,\u201d\n", " \u201cring, outside and inside: lines of fire that seemed\u201d\n", " \u201cThe misty morning crawleth grey from dusk to the reluctant day.\u201d\n", " \u201cBalrogs. Now these were demons with whips of flame and claws of steel by whom he tormented those of the Noldoli who durst withstand him in anything \u2013and the Eldar have called them Malkarauki.

They can be comic, but their comedy is suburban unless it is set against things more elemental.\u201d\n", " \u201cBut go now with good hearts! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!\u201d\n", " \u201chis talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, benevolent and wise.
