[" \u201cUnlooked-for?\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018I said that I would return and meet you here.\u2019 \u2018But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming. Strange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!\u201d\n", " \u201cThe evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed.\u201d\n", " \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!\u201d he said to himself, \u201cthinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age!\u201d\n", " \u201cThe air was warm. The sound of the running and falling water was loud, and the evning was filled with a faint scent of trees and floewrs, as f summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.\u201d\n", " \u201cHe rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, while the echoes ran away into the roof. The world was young, the mountains green, No stain yet on the Moon was seen, No words were laid on stream or stone When Durin woke and walked alone. He named the nameless hills and dells; He drank from yet untasted wells; He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear, As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head. The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall Of mighty kings in Nargothrond And Gondolin, who now beyond The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin\u2019s Day. A king he was on carven throne In many-pillared halls of stone With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright. There hammer on the anvil smote, There chisel clove, and graver wrote; There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; The delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, And metal wrought like fishes\u2019 mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, And shining spears were laid in hoard. Unwearied then were Durin\u2019s folk; Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang. The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge\u2019s fire is ashen-cold; No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin\u2019s halls; The shadow lies upon his tomb In Moria, in Khazad-d\u00fbm. But still the sunken stars appear In dark and windless Mirrormere; There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep. \u2018I\u201d\n", " \u201cMa in vece mia partirai tu, Portatore dell\u2019Anello, quando giunger\u00e0 l\u2019ora, e se lo vorrai.

Better than my design, and better even than my hope the event has proved.\u2019 \u2018Then if not yours, whose is the wizardry?\u2019 said Th\u00e9oden. \u2018Not Saruman\u2019s, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of whom we have yet to learn?\u2019 \u2018It is not wizardry, but a power far older,\u2019 said Gandalf: \u2018a power\u201d\n", " \u201cHe is the Master of wood, water, and hill.\u2019 \u2018Then all this strange land belongs to him?\u2019 \u2018No indeed!\u2019 she answered, and her smile faded. \u2018That would indeed be a burden,\u2019 she added in a low voice, as if to herself. \u2018The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear.

That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.\u201d\n", " \u201cWe are sitting in a fortress.
