[" \u201cNo!\u201d said Thorin. \u201cThere is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!\u201d Then\u201d\n", " \u201cShort cuts make delays, but inns make longer ones.\u201d\n", " \u201cWalk no more in the shadows, but awake!' said Aragorn. 'You are weary. Rest a while, and take food, and be ready when I return.'\n 'I will, lord,' said Faramir. 'For who would lie idle when the king has returned?\u201d\n", " \u201cOurs is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can mar or mend.\u201d\n", " \u201cWhat a lot of things you do use Good morning for!\u201d said Gandalf.\u201d\n", " \u201cYet also I should be sad,\u2019 said Th\u00e9oden. \u2018For however the fortune of war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall pass for ever out of Middle-earth?\u2019 \u2018It may,\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed. Let us now go on with the journey we have begun!\u2019 The\u201d\n", " \u201cThe appalling destruction and misery of this war mount hourly: destruction of what should be (indeed it is) the common wealth of Europe, and the world, if mankind were not so besotted, wealth the loss of which will affect us all, victors or not. Yet people gloat to hear of the endless lines, 40 miles long, of miserable refugees, women and children pouring West, dying on the way. There seems no bowels of mercy or compassion, no imagination, left in this dark diabolic hour. By which I do not mean that it may not all, in the present situation, mainly (not solely) created by Germany, be necessary or inevitable. But why gloat! We were supposed to have reached a stage of civilization in which it might still be necessary to execute a criminal, but not to gloat, or to hang his wife and child by him while the orc-crowd hooted. The destruction of Germany, be it 100 times merited, is one of the most appalling world-catastrophes.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe Eagles!\u201d cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras. Down the hillside the young Entwash, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud.\u201d\n", " \u201cLilly-flowers nodded their half-opened heads in the grass.\u201d\n", " \u201cSo do all in such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd so Gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. Sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay Frodo\u2019s head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of Sam\u2019s brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master\u2019s breast. Peace was in both their faces.\u201d\n", " \u201ccalled a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting\u201d\n", " \u201cNor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried.

Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will thank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and drop him for,\u201d\n", " \u201cThere was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, stating that on June the Twenty-second Messrs Grubb, Grubb, and Burrowes would sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of Bag-End, Underhill, Hobbiton.\u201d\n", " \u201cwhat he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose.
