It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait.\u201d\n", " \u201cFa\u00ebrie contains many things besides elves and fays, and besides dwarfs, witches, trolls, giants, or dragons; it holds the seas, the sun, the moon, the sky; and the earth, and all things that are in it: tree and bird, water and stone, wine and bread, and ourselves, mortal men, when we are enchanted.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill.\u201d\n", " \u201cCome, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you.\u201d\n", " \u201cSorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not Today. Good morning! But please come to tea -any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Good bye!\u201d\n", " \u201cThe way is shut. It was made by those who are Dead, and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is shut.\u201d\n", " \u201cFalse hopes are more dangerous than fears.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe whole thing is quite hopeless, so it's no good worrying about tomorrow. It probably won't come.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring\ufeff passed out of all knowledge.\u201d\n", " \u201cI wished to be loved by another,' [\u00c9owyn] answered. 'But I desire no man's pity.\u201d\n", " \u201cI will not walk backward in life.\u201d\n", " \u201cA safe fairyland is untrue to all worlds.\u201d\n", " \u201cVoiceless it cries,\n Wingless flutters,\n Toothless bites,\n Mouthless mutters.\u201d\n", " \u201cYou can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin \u2013 to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours \u2013 closer than you yourself keep it. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about the ring. We are horribly afraid\u2013but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.\u201d\n", " \u201cHow do you move on? You move on when your heart finally understands that there is no turning back.\u201d\n", " \u201cFarewell!

Tinuviel!\n He called her by her elvish name;\n And there she halted listening.\n One moment stood she, and a spell\n His voice laid on her: Beren came,\n And doom fell on Tinuviel\n That in his arms lay glistening.\n As Beren looked into her eyes\n Within the shadows of her hair,\n The trembling starlight of the skies\n He saw there mirrored shimmering.\n Tinuviel the elven-fair,\n Immortal maiden elven-wise,\n About him cast her shadowy hair\n And arms like silver glimmering.\n Long was the way that fate them bore,\n O'er stony mountains cold and grey,\n Through halls of iron and darkling door,\n And woods of nightshade morrowless.\n The Sundering Seas between them lay,\n And yet at last they met once more,\n And long ago they passed away\n In the forest singing sorrowless.\u201d\n", " \u201cEnd? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path. One that we all must take.\u201d\n", " \u201cEomer said, 'How is a man to judge what to do in such times?'\n As he has ever judged,' said Aragorn. 'Good and evil have not changed since yesteryear, nor are they one thing among Elves and another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden Wood as in his own house.\u201d\n", " \u201cA hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship.\u201d\n", " \u201cBut I am the real Strider, fortunately. I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.\u201d\n"]
