He was welcomed; and when they sat all at table in Merethrond, the Great Hall of Feasts, he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder. And before he went to his rest he sent for Gimli the Dwarf, and he said to him: \u2018Gimli Gl\u00f3in\u2019s son, have you your axe ready?\u2019 \u2018Nay, lord,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018but I can speedily fetch it, if there be need.\u2019 \u2018You shall judge,\u2019 said \u00c9omer. \u2018For there are certain rash words concerning the Lady in the Golden Wood that lie still between us. And now I have seen her with my eyes.\u2019 \u2018Well, lord,\u2019 said Gimli, \u2018and what say you now?\u2019 \u2018Alas!\u2019 said \u00c9omer. \u2018I will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives.\u2019 \u2018Then I must go for my axe,\u2019 said Gimli. \u2018But first I will plead this excuse,\u2019 said \u00c9omer. \u2018Had I seen her in other company, I would have said all that you could wish. But now I will put Queen Arwen Evenstar first, and I am ready to do battle on my own part with any who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?\u2019 Then Gimli bowed low. \u2018Nay, you are excused for my part, lord,\u2019 he said. \u2018You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning. And my heart forebodes that soon it will pass away for ever.\u201d\n", " \u201cEven in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find.\u201d\n", " \u201cMr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator.

Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.\u201d\n", " \u201cIn pigri giardini, molti fiori come te gli d\u00e8i innamorati sono soliti baciare d'un bacio che assomiglia al miele; e poi li buttano via, sciupati, e li calpestano, mentre emanano il profumo loro.

Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.'\n 'Deserves it!' I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.

His fire belched forth, the hall smoked, he shook the mountain-roots.
