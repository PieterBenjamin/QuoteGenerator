Maedhros it was that sang amid his torment. But Fingon climbed to the foot of the precipice where his kinsman hung; and then he could go no farther, and he wept when he saw the cruel device of Morgoth. Maedhros therefore, being in anguish without hope, begged Fingon to shoot him with his bow; and Fingon strung an arrow, and bent his bow. And seeing no better hope he cried to Manwe, saying: 'O King to whom birds are dear, speed now this feathered shaft, and recall some pity for the Noldor in their need!'....Now, even as Fingon bent his bow, there flew down from the high airs Thorondor, King of Eagles, mightiest of all birds that have ever been, whose outstretched wings spanned thirty fathoms; and staying Fingon's hand he took him up, and bore him to the face of the rock where Maethros hung.\u201d\n", " \u201cNeed brooks no delay, yet late is better than never.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,\u2019 said Aragorn. \u2018There are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark.\u201d\n", " \u201csongs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.\u201d\n", " \u201cAs a lord was held\n for the strength of his body and stoutness of heart.\n Much lore he learned, and loved wisdom\n but fortune followed him in few desires;\n oft wrong and awry what he wrought turned;\n what he loved he lost, what he longed for he won not;\n and full friendship he found not easily,\n nor was lightly loved for his looks were sad.\n He was gloom-hearted, and glad seldom\n for the sundering sorrow that filled his youth...\n (On Turin Turambar - The Children of Hurin)\u201d\n", " \u201cChildren are meant to grow up, and not to become Peter Pans.

Wraiths on wings!\u201d\n", " \u201c[T]here were two musics progressing at one time before the seat of Il\u00favatar, and they were utterly at variance. The one was deep and wide and beautiful, but slow and blended with an immeasurable sorrow, from which its beauty chiefly came. The other had now achieved a unity of its own; but it was loud, and vain, and endlessly repeated; and it had little harmony, but rather a clamorous unison as of many trumpets braying upon a few notes. And it essayed to drown the other music by the violence of its voice, but it seemed that its most triumphant notes were taken by the other and woven into its own solemn pattern.\u201d\n", " \u201cI know why you seek solitude. You suffer; I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo, other paths that we might take.\n I know what you would say.

Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it.\u201d\n", " \u201cHige sceal pe heardra, heorte pe cenre,\n mod sceal pe mare pe ure maegen lytlao.\n ( Will shall be the sterner, heart the bolder, spirit the greater as\n our strength lessens. )\u201d\n", " \u201cWell I've made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf \u2013 mountains; and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my book.

But two together may perhaps find wisdom.\u201d\n", " \u201cNot long ago-incredible though it may seem-I heard a clerk of Oxford declare that he 'welcomed' the proximity of mass-production robot factories, and the roar of self-obstructive traffic, because it brought his university into 'contact with real life.' He may have meant that the way men were living and working in the twentieth century was increasing in barbarity at an alarming rate, and that the loud demonstration of this in the streets of Oxford might serve as a warning that it is not possible to preserve for long an oasis of sanity in a desert of unreason by mere fences, without actual offensive action (practical and intellectual). I fear he did not. In any case the expression 'real life' in this context seems to fall short of academic standards. The notion that motor-cars are more 'alive' than, say, centaurs or dragons is curious; that they are more 'real' than, say, horses is pathetically absurd. How real, how startlingly alive is a factory chimney compared with an elm tree: poor obsolete thing, insubstantial dream of an escapist!\u201d\n", " \u201cI am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me!\u201d\n", " \u201cIt was an irresistible development of modern illustration (so largely photographic) that borders should be abandoned and the \"picture\" end only with the paper. This method may be suitable for for photographs; but it is altogether inappropriate for the pictures that illustrate or are inspired by fairy-stories. An enchanted forest requires a margin, even an elaborate border. To print it coterminous with the page, like a \"shot\" of the Rockies in Picture Post, as if it were indeed a \"snap\" of fairyland or a \"sketch by our artist on the spot\", is a folly and an abuse.\u201d\n", " \u201cI shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do not lead us well.\u201d\n", " \u201cThe Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.\u201d\n", " \u201cAre we riding far tonight, Gandalf?\u201d asked Merry after a while. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.\u201d\n \u201cSo you heard that?\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cDon\u2019t let it rankle! Be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort to your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in his thoughts than the rest of us. Who you are; how you came here, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the orcs perished\u2014it is with those little riddles that the great mind of Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.\u201d\n \u201cThank you!\u201d said Merry. \u201cBut it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time. Are we riding far tonight?\u201d\n Gandalf laughed. \u201cA most unquenchable hobbit! All wizards should have a hobbit or two in their care\u2014to teach them the meaning of the world, and to correct them.\u201d\n", " \u201cA time may come soon,\" said he, \"when none will return. Then there will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds that are done in the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.\u201d\n", " \u201cThank you, Sam,\" he said in a cracked whisper. \"How far is there to go?\"\n I don't know,\" said Sam, \"because I don't know where we're going.\u201d\n", " \u201cAlways after a defeat and a respite,\" says Gandalf, \"the shadow takes another shape and grows again.\"\n \"I wish it need not have happened in my time,\" says Frodo.\n \"So do I,\" says Gandalf, \"and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\u201d\n", " \u201cSlowly the lights of the torches in front of Merry flicked and went out, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: \u2018This is a tunnel leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.\u2019 But suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice.\n \u2018Well, Merry! Thank goodness I have found you!\u2019\n He looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. There was Pippin! They were face to face in a narrow lane, but for themselves it was empty. He rubbed his eyes.\n \u2018Where is the king?\u2019 He said. \u2018And Eowyn?\u2019 Then he stumbled and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again.\n \u2018They must have gone up into the Citadel,\u2019 said Pippin. \u2018I think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning. When we found out you were not with them, Gandalf sent me to look for you. Poor old Merry! How glad I am to see you again! But you are worn out, and I won\u2019t bother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?\u2019\n \u2018No,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018Well, no, I don\u2019t think so. But I can\u2019t use my right arm, Pippin, not since I stabbed him. And my sword burned away like a piece of wood.\u2019\n Pippin\u2019s face was anxious. \u2018Well, you had better come with me as quick as you can,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wish I could carry you. You aren\u2019t fit to walk any further. They shouldn\u2019t have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the City, Merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from battle is easily overlooked.\u2019\n \u2018It\u2019s not always a misfortune being overlooked,\u2019 said Merry. \u2018I was overlooked just now by\u2014no, no, I can\u2019t speak of it. Help me, Pippin! It\u2019s all going dark again, and my arm is so cold.\u2019\n \u2018Lean on me, Merry lad!\u201d said Pippin. \u2018Come now. Foot by foot. It\u2019s not far.\u2019\n \u2018Are you going to bury me?\u2019 said Merry.\n \u2018No, indeed!\u2019 said Pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart was wrung with fear and pity. \u2018No, we are going to the Houses of Healing.\u201d\n"]
