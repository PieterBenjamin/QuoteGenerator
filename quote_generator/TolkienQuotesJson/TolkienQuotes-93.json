His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is, where he comes from, and if he really was evil at heart.

He had gone the way of all tyrants: beginning well, at least on the level that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of the Earth. But he went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for domination, being in origin an immortal (angelic) spirit.* In The Lord of the Rings the conflict is not basically about 'freedom', though that is naturally involved. It is about God, and His sole right to divine honour. The Eldar and the N\u00famen\u00f3reans believed in The One, the true God, and held worship of any other person an abomination. Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants; if he had been victorious he would have demanded divine honour from all rational creatures and absolute temporal power over the whole world.\u201d\n", " \u201cSuddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up\u2014probably somebody lighting a wood-fire\u2014and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames.\u201d\n", " \u201c\u00c8 divenuto cos\u00ec strano il mondo!

They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.\u201d\n", " \u201c\u041d\u043e \u041e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0434\u044a\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438. \u0421\u044a\u0440\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043c \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u044a\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0433\u044a\u043d\u044f. \u0421\u044a\u0447\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0445\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0440 \u0447\u0435 \u043e\u0433\u044a\u043d\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e \u0441\u044a\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0438 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u043c, \u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0445\u0430 \u0440\u044a\u0446\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043c\u044a\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0445\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u0440\u044a\u0433 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u044a\u0445\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438 \u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430. \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u044f\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430; \u043d\u043e\u0449\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434 \u0442\u044f\u0445 \u0431\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430.\n \u0410\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0445\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u0440\u0437\u043e, \u0430 \u0441\u043d\u0435\u0433\u044a\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044a\u043b\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u201d\n", " \u201cIl bene e il male sono rimasti immutati da sempre, e il loro significato \u00e8 il medesimo per gli Elfi, per i Nani e per gli Uomini.
