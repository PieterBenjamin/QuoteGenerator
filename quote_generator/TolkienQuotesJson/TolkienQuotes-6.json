Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!\"\n Then Merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest.

But I suppose it\u2019s often that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo, adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and\n looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that\u2019s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn\u2019t. And if they had, we shouldn\u2019t know, because they\u2019d have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on, and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same; like old Mr Bilbo. But those aren\u2019t always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we\u2019ve fallen into?\u201d\n \u201cI wonder,\u201d said Frodo, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s the way of a real tale. Take any one that you\u2019re fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don\u2019t know.

It does not deny the existence of dyscatastrophe, of sorrow and failure: the possibility of these is necessary to the joy of deliverance; it denies (in the face of much evidence, if you will) universal final defeat and in so far is evangelium, giving a fleeting glimpse of Joy, Joy beyond the walls of the world, poignant as grief.\u201d\n", " \u201cYou may not like my burglar, but please don't damage him.\u201d\n", " \u201cI wonder if people will ever say, \"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.\" And they'll say, \"Yes, that's one of my favorite stories.
