[" \u201cAs they sang the hobbit felt in love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves.\u201d\n", " \u201cStill that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. 'He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can.\u201d\n", " \u201cUpon the hearth the fire is red,\n Beneath the roof there is a bed;\n But not yet weary are our feet,\n Still round the corner we may meet\n A sudden tree or standing stone\n That none have seen but we alone.\n Tree and flower and leaf and grass,\n Let them pass! Let them pass!\u201d\n", " \u201cGive with a free hand, but give of your own.\u201d\n", " \u201cA light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced.\u201d\n", " \u201cThus died Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, most proud and valiant of the Elven-kings of old.\u201d\n", " \u201cStruck by lightning! Struck by lightning!\u201d\n", " \u201cI wonder,' said Frodo. 'It's my doom, I think, to go to that Shadow yonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to me?\u201d\n", " \u201cStep onto the road and there\u2019s no telling where you might be swept off to.\u201d\n", " \u201cNo ames demasiado la obra de tus manos ni las invenciones de tu coraz\u00f3n.\u201d\n", " \u201ctill suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It was a turning-point in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly, it did not seem of any use at the moment.\u201d\n", " \u201cWhere and what are Helm\u2019s Deep and all the rest of it?\u201d said Merry. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this country.\u201d\n \u201cThen you\u2019d best learn something, if you wish to understand what is happening,\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cBut not just now, and not from me: I have too many pressing things to think about.\u201d\n \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tackle Strider at the camp-fire: he\u2019s less testy. But why all this secrecy? I though we\u2019d won the battle!\u201d\n", " \u201cBut, but, lord,\" Merry stammered, \"I offered you my sword. I do not want to be parted from you like this, Theoden King. And as all my friends have gone to battle, I should be ashamed to stay behind.\"\n \"But we ride on horses tall and swift,\" said Theoden; \"and great though your heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.\"\n \"Then tie me on the back of one, or let me hang on a stirrup, or something,\" said Merry. \"It is a long way to run; but run I shall, if I cannot ride, even if I wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.\u201d\n", " \u201cI wrote The Lord of the Rings because I wished \u2018to try my hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them.\u201d\n", " \u201cLet me think!' said Aragorn. 'And now may I make a right choice, and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for a moment. 'I will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I must abandon the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer. The Company has played its part. Yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared behind! We will press on by day and dark!\u201d\n", " \u201cThings might have been different, but they could not have been better. - From \"Leaf by Niggle\u201d\n", " \u201cWe cannot achieve victory by arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his only chance, frail though it be.\u201d\n", " \u201cHullo!\u201d said Merry. \u201cSo that\u2019s what is bothering you? Now, Pippin my lad, don\u2019t forget Gildor\u2019s saying\u2014the one Sam used to quote: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.\u201d\n \u201cBut our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of Wizards,\u201d said Pippin. \u201cI should like a bit of information as well as danger. I should like a look at that ball.\u201d\n \u201cGo to sleep!\u201d said Merry. \u201cYou\u2019ll get information enough, sooner or later. My dear Pippin, no Took ever beat a Brandybuck for inquisitiveness; but is it this time, I ask you?\u201d\n \u201cAll right! What\u2019s the harm in my telling you what I should like: a look at that stone? I know I can\u2019t have it, with old Gandalf sitting on it, like a hen on an egg. But it doesn\u2019t help much to get no more from you than a you-can\u2019t-have-it-so-go-to-sleep!\u201d\n \u201cWell, what else could I say?\u201d said Merry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pippin, but you really must wait till the morning. I\u2019ll be as curious as you like after breakfast, and I\u2019ll help you in any way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can\u2019t keep awake any longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split at the ears. Good night!\u201d\n", " \u201cFor the Quest is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam.\u201d\n", " \u201cMay your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years!\u201d\n", " \u201cSee, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord Sm\u00e9agol? Gollum the Great? The Gollum! Eat fish every day, three times a day, fresh from the sea.\u201d\n", " \u201cIndeed if fish had fish-lore and Wise-fish, it is probable that the business of anglers would be very little hindered.\u201d\n", " \u201cYet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd so it was settled. Sam Gamgee married Rose Cotton in the spring of 1420 (which was also famous for its weddings), and they came and lived at Bag End. And if Sam thought himself lucky, Frodo knew that he was more lucky himself; for there was not a hobbit in the Shire that was looked after with such care. When the labours or repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet life, writing a good deal and going through all his notes. He resigned the office of Deputy Mayor at the Free Fair that Midsummer, and dear old Will Whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at Banquets.\u201d\n", " \u201cMan, Sub-creator, the refracted Light\n through whom is splintered from a single White\n to many hues, and endlessly combined\n in living shapes that move from mind to mind.\u201d\n", " \u201cEach day before the end of eve\n she sought her lover, nor would him leave,\n until the stars were dimmed, and day\n came glimmering eastward silver-grey.\n Then trembling-veiled she would appear,\n and dance before him, half in fear;\n there flitting just before his feet\n she gently chid with laughter sweet:\n 'Come! dance now, Beren, dance with me!\n For fain thy dancing I would see!\u201d\n", " \u201cI thought all the trees were whispering to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd she answered: 'All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, you leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.'\n 'What do you fear, lady?' he asked.\n 'A cage,' she said.\u201d\n", " \u201cEldest, that's what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People, and saw the Little People arriving. He was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from Outside.\u201d\n", " \u201cIt needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, Master Warden,' answered \u00c9owyn. 'And those who have not swords can still die upon them.\u201d\n"]
