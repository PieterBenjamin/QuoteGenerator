[" \u201cFrodo: I can't do this, Sam.\n Sam: I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness, and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it'll shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.\n Frodo: What are we holding on to, Sam?\n Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo...and it's worth fighting for.\u201d\n", " \u201cFor you do not yet know the strengths of your hearts, and you cannot foresee what each may meet on the road.\u201d\n", " \u201cDeeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.\u201d\n", " \u201cCeltic 'is a magic bag, into which anything may be put, and out of which almost anything may come . . .

Ruining, perverting, misapplying, and making for ever accursed, that noble northern spirit, a supreme contribution to Europe, which I have ever loved, and tried to present in its true light.\u201d\n", " \u201cSo the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it from his window, deep in the heavens, burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley.\u201d\n", " \u201cHow would this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after?'\n 'It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo.\n 'Ah!' said Sam.

In Dasent's words I would say: 'We must be satisfied with the soup that is set before us, and not desire to see the bones of the ox out of which it has been boiled.'\n Such stories have now a mythical or total (unanalysable) effect, an effect quite independent of the findings of Comparative Folk-lore, and one which it cannot spoil or explain; they open a door on Other Time, and if we pass through, though only for a moment, we stand outside our own time, outside Time itself, maybe.\u201d\n", " \u201cO Elbereth!

But for a long while they sang only each alone, or but few together, while the rest hearkened; for each comprehended only that part of the mind of Il\u00favatar from which he came, and in the understanding of their brethren they grew but slowly.
