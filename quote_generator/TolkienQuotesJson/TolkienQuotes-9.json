[" \u201cA man inherited a field in which was an accumulation of old stone, part of an older hall. Of the old stone some had already been used in building the house in which he actually lived, not far from the old house of his fathers. Of the rest he took some and built a tower. But his friends coming perceived at once (without troubling to climb the steps) that these stones had formerly belonged to a more ancient building. So they pushed the tower over, with no little labour, and in order to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions, or to discover whence the man's distant forefathers had obtained their building material. Some suspecting a deposit of coal under the soil began to dig for it, and forgot even the stones. They all said: 'This tower is most interesting.' But they also said (after pushing it over): 'What a muddle it is in!' And even the man's own descendants, who might have been expected to consider what he had been about, were heard to murmur: 'He is such an odd fellow! Imagine using these old stones just to build a nonsensical tower! Why did not he restore the old house? he had no sense of proportion.' But from the top of that tower the man had been able to look out upon the sea.\u201d\n", " \u201chis old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd yet their wills did not yield, and they struggled on.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd sometimes you didn't want to know the end\u2026 because how could the end be happy?\u201d\n", " \u201cFew other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness and shame for a man's heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned.\u201d\n", " \u201cWe set out to save the Shire, Sam and it has been saved - but not for me.\u201d\n", " \u201cI am in fact a Hobbit in all but size. I like gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmlands; I smoke a pipe, and like good plain food (unrefrigerated), but detest French cooking; I like, and even dare to wear in these dull days, ornamental waistcoats. I am fond of mushrooms (out of a field); have a very simple sense of humor (which even my appreciative critics find tiresome); I go to bed late and get up late (when possible). I do not travel much.\u201d\n", " \u201cAnd now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!\u201d\n", " \u201cI may be a burglar...but I'm an honest one, I hope, more or less.\u201d\n", " \u201cDo we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?'\n A man may do both,' said Aragorn. 'For not we but those who come after will make the legends of our time. The green earth, say you? That is a mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!\u201d\n", " \u201cWe all long for Eden, and we are constantly glimpsing it: our whole nature at its best and least corrupted, its gentlest and most human, is still soaked with the sense of exile.\u201d\n", " \u201cMy friend, you had horses, and deed of arms, and the free fields; but she, being born in the body of a maid, had a spirit and courage at least the match of yours. Yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man, whom she loved as a father, and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured dotage; and her part seemed to her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on.\n -Gandalf to Eomer, of Eowyn\u201d\n", " \u201cNo taste of food, no feel of water, no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or star are left to me. I am naked in the dark, Sam, and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I begin to see it even with my waking eyes, and all else fades.\u201d\n", " \u201cI want to see mountains again, Gandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.\u201d\n", " \u201cTomorrow we may come this way,\n And take the hidden paths that run\n Towards the Moon or to the Sun\u201d\n", " \u201cThough here at journey's end I lie\n In darkness buried deep,\n Beyond all towers strong and high,\n Beyond all mountains steep,\n Above all shadows rides the Sun\n And Stars for ever dwell:\n I will not say the Day is done,\n Nor bid the Stars farewell.\u201d\n", " \u201cStill, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in one, of course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out loud of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years afterwards. And people will say: 'Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring' and they'll say 'Oh yes, that's one of my favorite stories.\u201d\n", " \u201cHe loved mountains, or he had loved the thought of them marching on the edge of stories brought from far away; but now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He longed to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire.\u201d\n", " \u201cThus Aragorn for the first time in the full light of day beheld \u00c9owyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like a morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood. And she was now suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, greycloaked, hiding a power that yet she felt. For a moment still as stone she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone.\u201d\n", " \u201cThief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!\u201d\n", " \u201cHere was one with an air of high nobility such as Aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the Eldar Race. He knew now why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.\u201d\n", " \u201cNobody believes me when I say that my long book is an attempt to create a world in which a form of language agreeable to my personal aesthetic might seem real. But it is true.\u201d\n", " \u201cYour lullaby would waken a drunken goblin!\u201d\n", " \u201cIt is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope.\u201d\n", " \u201cNot all those who wander are lost\u201d\n", " \u201cI sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:\n Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.\n Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,\n And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a Golden Tree.\n Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,\n In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.\n There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,\n While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.\n O L\u00f3rien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore\n And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.\n But if of ships I now would sing, what ship would come to me,\n What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?\u201d\n", " \u201cWhy should a man be scorned, if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using Escape in this way the critics have chosen the wrong word, and, what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere error, the Escape of the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter. just so a Party-spokesman might have labeled departure from the misery of the Fuhrer's or any other Reich and even criticism of it as treachery .... Not only do they confound the escape of the prisoner with the flight of the deserter; but they would seem to prefer the acquiescence of the \"quisling\" to the resistance of the patriot.\u201d\n", " \u201cThrough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows\n The West Wind goes walking, and about the walls it goes.\n What news from the West, oh wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?\n Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?\n \u2018I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;\n I saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away\n Into the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more.\n The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.\u2019\n Oh, Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar.\n But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\n From the mouth of the sea the South Wind flies,\n From the sand hills and the stones;\n The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans\n What news from the South, oh sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?\n Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.\n \u2018Ask me not where he doth dwell--so many bones there lie\n On the white shores and on the black shores under the stormy sky;\n So many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing sea.\n Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!\u2019\n Oh Boromir! Beyond the gate the Seaward road runs South,\n But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth.\n From the Gate of Kings the North Wind rides,\n And past the roaring falls\n And loud and cold about the Tower its loud horn calls.\n What news from the North, oh mighty wind, do you bring to me today?\n What news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.\n \u2018Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought\n His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.\n His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;\n And Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls, bore him upon its breast.\u2019\n Oh Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze\n To Rauros, Golden Rauros Falls until the end of days.\u201d\n", " \u201cHere you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!\u201d\n", " \u201cFor I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours!'\n I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.\n I liked white better,' I said.\n White!' he sneered. 'It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.'\n In which case it is no longer white,' said I. 'And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.' - Gandalf\u201d\n"]
