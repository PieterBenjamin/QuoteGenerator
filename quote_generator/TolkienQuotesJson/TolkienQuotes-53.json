[" \u201cSo was I,\u2019 said Frodo, \u2018and so I am. We\u2019re going on a bit too fast. You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point: \u201cShut the book now, dad; we don\u2019t want to read any more.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Sam, \u2018but I wouldn\u2019t be one to say that. Things done and over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even Gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he used to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks he\u2019s the hero or the villain?\u201d\n", " \u201cOf course, it is likely enough, my friends,\u2019 he said slowly, \u2018likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents.

ENTWIFE. When Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last; When broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past; I\u2019ll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again: Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!

But tell me, what would you do with such a gift?\u2019\n \u2018Treasure it, Lady,\u2019 he answered, \u2018in memory of your words to me at our first meeting.

Actually I may say he put on his ring early in the business, and vanished from sight, if not from all danger.
